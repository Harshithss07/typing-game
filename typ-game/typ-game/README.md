# Typing Game

## Overview
The Typing Game is a fun and interactive game designed to improve typing speed and accuracy. Players are presented with random words and must type them as quickly as possible within a set time limit.

## Files
- `src/main.js`: Contains the main JavaScript code for the game, handling game logic, user input, and interactions.
- `index.html`: The main HTML document that structures the game interface, including elements for displaying the word, input field, score, timer, and game over message.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore in the Git repository.

## How to Set Up
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to start the game.

## How to Play
1. Type the words displayed on the screen as quickly as possible.
2. Your score will increase with each correct word typed.
3. The game ends when the timer runs out, and your final score will be displayed.
